    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>My name is FrenchBread49. I own a YouTube channel (which is a secret), a Scratcher, and a person who loves to code things! I like learning new things, like how I am learning HTML and JavaScript using an app called Codecademy and learning Spanish (Don't kill me Duolingo...).</p>
