    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>My name is FrenchBread49. I own a YouTube channel (which is a secret) (Not anymore, see <a href= https://github.com/Drogoton> Drogoton (GitHub)</a> and <a href=http://dr.nwpixs.com/yt> Drogoton (YT)</a> (2 different links)), a Scratcher (nope), and a person who loves to code things! (I couldn't call myself a coder before, I didn't code a discord bot when this was made) I like learning new things, like how I am learning HTML and JavaScript using an app called Codecademy (That went out the door pretty fucking fast) and learning Spanish (Don't kill me Duolingo...) (Again, didn't last).</p>
